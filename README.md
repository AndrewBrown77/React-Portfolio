# React-Portfolio

I encourage you to revisit the built-in features of **‘create-react-app’** and explore its overall structure, component-based design, and inheritance. React is an amazing front-end framework, and the way it integrates with Node.js on the back end makes it a powerful tool in your development journey

Here’s a breakdown of areas to improve ,Header Component: Great job creating a reusable Header with conditional rendering of the **About Me**, **Portfolio**, **Contact**, and **Resume** sections. Project Component: The Portfolio section could benefit from a reusable **Project component** to display each project. This would reduce code duplication and make it easier to manage. Footer Component:** Adding a **Footer component** that appears across multiple pages will enhance the structure and user experience. About Me Section:** This section is missing a **photo/avatar** and a **bio**. Including these will help personalize your portfolio.Portfolio Section: Aim to include **6 deployed projects** with images, along with links to both the **deployed applications** and their corresponding **repositories**. Contact Section: Adding a **contact form with field validation will elevate this section and ensure it works seamlessly. Resume Section: Make sure to include a **link to download your resume** and provide a **list of your proficiencies** here.README: A high-quality README will tie everything together. Be sure to include **screenshots, a description,** and a **link to the deployed application** so others can easily explore your work.
